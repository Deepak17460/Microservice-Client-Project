# Microservice-Client-Project

This project demonstrates a full-duplex Microservice-Client-Project architecture implemented using various technologies including Docker, SonarQube, Eureka, Ocelot, RabbitMQ, Docker-Compose-File, and SQL Server.

## Description

The project showcases the implementation of a microservices architecture with bidirectional communication, facilitated by Docker containers. It leverages various technologies to build a scalable and resilient system.

## Technologies Used

- Docker: For containerization and deployment of microservices.
- SonarQube: For continuous code quality analysis.
- Eureka: For service discovery and registration.
- Ocelot: For API Gateway functionality.
- RabbitMQ: For asynchronous messaging between microservices.
- Docker Compose: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- SQL Server: For data storage and retrieval.
